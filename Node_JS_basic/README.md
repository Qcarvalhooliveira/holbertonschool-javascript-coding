# **NodeJS Basics** :computer:

## **Description** :speech_balloon:

* Node.js Basics refers to the fundamental concepts and foundational knowledge associated with Node.js, which is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a web browser. Understanding Node.js Basics involves learning about its core features, event-driven architecture, asynchronous programming, modules and packages, handling I/O operations, building servers, and managing dependencies. It's a crucial starting point for anyone looking to develop applications using Node.js, enabling them to create efficient and scalable server-side applications and services using JavaScript.

## **What we should learn from this project:** :bookmark_tabs:

* run javascript using NodeJS
* use NodeJS modules
* use specific Node JS module to read files
* use process to access command line arguments and the environment
* create a small HTTP server using Node JS
* create a small HTTP server using Express JS
* create advanced routes with Express JS
* use ES6 with Node JS with Babel-node
* use Nodemon to develop faster

## **Tasks:** :books:

#### **0. Executing basic javascript with Node JS**

* In the file 0-console.js, create a function named displayMessage that prints in STDOUT the string argument.

#### **1. Using Process stdin**

* Create a program named 1-stdin.js that will be executed through command line

#### **2. Reading a file synchronously with Node JS**

* Using the database database.csv (provided in project description), create a function countStudents in the file 2-read_file.js

#### **3. Reading a file asynchronously with Node JS**

* Using the database database.csv (provided in project description), create a function countStudents in the file 3-read_file_async.js

#### **4. Create a small HTTP server using Node's HTTP module**

* In a file named 4-http.js, create a small HTTP server using the http module

#### **5. Create a more complex HTTP server using Node's HTTP module**

* In a file named 5-http.js, create a small HTTP server using the http module

#### **6. Create a small HTTP server using Express**

* Install Express and in a file named 6-http_express.js, create a small HTTP server using Express module

#### **7. Create a more complex HTTP server using Express**

* In a file named 7-http_express.js, recreate the small HTTP server using Express

#### **8. Organize a complex HTTP server using Express**

* Obviously writing every part of a server within a single file is not sustainable. Letâ€™s create a full server in a directory named full_server.

* 8.1 Organize the structure of the server

* 8.2 Write the App controller

* 8.3 Write the Students controller

* 8.4 Write the routes

* 8.5 Write the server reusing everything you created

* 8.6 Update package.json (if you are running it from outside the folder full_server)
