# **JavaScript - Web scraping** :computer:

## **Description:** :speech_balloon:

* Web scraping in JavaScript involves extracting data from websites on the internet. JavaScript, often used in web development, has various libraries and frameworks that enable web scraping. Developers use these tools to fetch data from web pages, parse the HTML content, and extract the desired information, which can then be used for various purposes like data analysis, automation, or integration with other applications. Web scraping can be employed to gather information such as text, images, links, or other structured data from websites.
